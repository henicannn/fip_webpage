        <h2>
            TORONTO PUBLIC SAFETY DATA
        </h2>

        <p>
            Lucky are those who have their attention around in public traffic. Every day there are lots of accidents around the world. Somewhere people are safe, but there are some accidents where people are unfortunate. So, taking a look at one of the world's largest
            city -Toronto, we found out some interesting facts about cyclist related collisions and about pedestrian-related collisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            About 87% of pedestrian and 99% of cyclist injuries occurred on roadways. More analyzing the public data obtained from the Toronto police website, we found out that about 13% of pedestrian and 1% of cyclist injuries occurred off-road in parks, private
            property, or public lanes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of the cyclists go through accidents while going ahead straight down the road.
        </p>

        <p>
            About all of the pedestrian accidents from GTA, 70% of them occur in downtown Toronto.
